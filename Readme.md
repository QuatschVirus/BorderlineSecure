(Yes, this text, like most of the longer texts in the game, has been mostly written by ChatGPT. I personally think it adds to the dystopian vibe of the game. Also, I'm lazy and uncreative.)

## The Technical Side
Most of the game is written in Python, and the player interacts with the world through a simple console. Still, it incorporates PDF-documents and pictures for visualized data, like documents presented to the player, manuals and more.
Nearly every text in this game is not hard-coded, allowing for translated files to be inserted by the end user.  
I do plan on making a somewhat GUI-based version of this gamer using tkinter later on.

## Gameplay
The gameplay relies heavily on its file structure, where documents and pictures will be placed for the player to interact with. Make sure to check your mailbox (`/mailbox` in the games base directory) from time to time!
